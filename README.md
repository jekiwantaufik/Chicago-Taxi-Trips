Chicago Taxi Trips (BigQuery Dataset)

About Dataset
Context
Taxicabs in Chicago, Illinois, are operated by private companies and licensed by the city. There are about seven thousand licensed cabs operating within the city limits. Licenses are obtained through the purchase or lease of a taxi medallion which is then affixed to the top right hood of the car.

Content
This dataset includes taxi trips from 2013 to the present, reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are. See http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-data-released for more information about this dataset and how it was created.
